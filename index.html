   <b>Let's learn and build together. </b><br/>
<p>React.js is a very powerfull and popular library for frontend development.<br/>
We are going to make a team of react.js developers. But here is the twist😉. We are also taking people who don't even know the ABC of web development. We will teach them how to work<br/>and the entry fee for them is just 1000 TAKA and if you know development you can teach them and earn. </p>
